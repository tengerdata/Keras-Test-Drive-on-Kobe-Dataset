# Keras-Test-Drive-on-Kobe-Dataset
The purpose of this notebook is to experiment with Keras on the Kobe dataset from Kaggle. In this notebook the preprocessing is absolutely minimal. The aim of this notebook is not to achieve maximum accuracy; the point is to explore how the Keras Sequential Model can be applied to this dataset.
